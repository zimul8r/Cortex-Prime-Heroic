# CortexPrime
Character sheet(s) for Cortex Prime focusing on a Cortex Plus Marvel Heroic-compatible implementation.
The top of the sheet is a dice pool roller application. 
Buttons on the sheet add dice to your pool, or you can add them in the roller itself.
The d20 button in the roller rolls your dice into the chat.
The sheet requires the ChatSetAttr API script to function properly.

THE DICE POOL APP
The dice pool app is at the top of the character sheets. It is inspired in part by the DiceStream app that was once available in Google Hangouts. 

The controls are fairly simple:

To roll any single die, click on the picture of that die. That die will be rolled in the Roll20 Chat window.

To add dice to the pool, click the roller wheel below the picture of a die to increase to counter below the chosen die type.

Once you've selected how many of each type of die you want in your pool, press the ROLL button. Your dice will be rolled in the Roll20 Chat window.

There is also a CLEAR button to clear your old pool, or clear the pool if you need to start fresh. The CLEAR button has a pop up "Are you sure" window to avoid inadvertently erasing a nice large dice pool you have just lovingly created.

That's it. It's pretty simple. The character sheets themselves have additional interfaces to the dice pool roller that are explained in their handouts.

Also, in the event that you just want to use ROLL20 and this pool dice roller and not the specific character sheets, there is a Dice Roller Only button available for just that scenario. I use a Dice Roller Only character for my Doom Pool.

THE CHARACTER SHEET
The MHRP Character Sheet allows the player to step through their character details, selecting dice that are relevant to their current action, then roll their dice pool.
When you create the character, you enter all the Distinctions, Powers, SFX, Limits, Specialties, Milestones for your character, and set all of the die sizes for your Affiliations, Powers, and Specialties.

To build a dice pool, clicking the "ADD" button adds a trait die to the dice pool roller above the sheet. The only exception is the Distinctions. Since they can be taken as either a d8 or a d4 (to earn a PP), they have a d8 and d4 picture button to select which you want to add to your pool.

Once you've selected all of your dice, you can manually edit your dice pool to implement any SFX or Limits (stepping up or down, doubling dice, etc.), or to add any external Complication, Stress, Scene Distinction, Asset, Resource, Push, or Stunt dice.

At the top of the sheet there are 4 check boxes. These hide or reveal the 3 Power Sets and the Milestones. This is to simplify the appearance for characters that only have 1 or 2 Power Sets. Often, when running one-shot games we do not use Milestones, so I made them hide-able as well to give people more options when managing limited screen space in Roll20.

For Powers, SFX and Limits, and Specialties, only the first row exists on a new blank character sheet. The "+Add" button allows you to add new rows of powers, etc. depending on how many the character needs. The "Modify" button will allow you to delete unneeded rows, or to reorder existing rows (except for the first).

Do not confuse the "+Add" button for adding rows with the "ADD" button for adding a trait's die to your dice pool.

I have not integrated Plot Points, nor temporary traits (Stress, Complications, Stunts, etc.) into the sheet. We are using Roll20 card decks to implement these. See the "Plot Points and Temporary Trait Dice" handout for more details.

In addition to the character sheet and the dice roller only sheet, there is an NPC sheet button. This uses all the same conventions, but I have added a multiplier entry in front of the Affiliation dice. This allows for NPC mob or LST dice. For example, the Copy of Nebula's Mercs (NPC MOB) is a 4d8 mob, which you can see in their Solo affiliation if you select the NPC Sheet button at the top when viewing them.
